Hello r/embedded I have some noob questions

1. I want to make a pcb with a stm32f412rgt6 using usb-type-c
do I need a *bridge rectifier* or is there a other component that cat turn ac to dc
2. dose a voltage regulator lower the amount of voltage in a ic
3. do I connect connect all the usb-type-c pin A to there mirror like connecting A1 to B12 or A5 to B5
