V = Electric pressure = Volts
1KV = 1000V
1MV = 0.001V
I = Electric current = Amps
R = Electric resistance = Ohms
P = Power = Wats
Amps = the measurement of electric current
1mA = 0.001A
Ohms = the measurement of Electric resistance

P = V * I
P = I2 * R
P = P2 / R
V = I * R
R = V / I
I = V / R
I = P / V
