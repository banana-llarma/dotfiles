### What is a diode

A diode is defined as a two-terminal electronic component that only conducts
current in one direction (so long as it is operated within a specified voltage
level). An ideal diode will have zero resistance in one direction, and infinite
resistance in the reverse direction.

A diode is used to limet the flow of current to one direction and block it from
going the other direction
