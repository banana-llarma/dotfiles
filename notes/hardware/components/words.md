### Power

- Voltage = Electric pressure
- Current = Electric flow, 
- Resistance = Electric obstruction
- Amps = the measurement of electric current
- Ohms = the measurement of Electric resistance
- AC = alternating current
- DC = direct current
- Watts = voltage * current, V * I
- IC = integrated circuit
- Ohms Law = ?
- I2C | IIC = Inter-Integrated Circuit  
I2C is a serial communication protocol, so data is transferred bit by bit along a single wire (the SDA line).
- UART = 
- SPI =
