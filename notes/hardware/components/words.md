### Power

- Voltage = Electric pressure
- Current = Electric flow, 
- Resistance = Electric obstruction
- Amps = the measurement of electric current
- Ohms = the measurement of Electric resistance
- AC = alternating current
- DC = direct current
- Watts = voltage * current, V * I
- IC = integrated circuit
- I2C | IIC = Inter-Integrated Circuit  
- UART = universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter
- SPI = Serial Peripheral Interface
