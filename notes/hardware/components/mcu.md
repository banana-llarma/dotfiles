### What is a MCU
A MCU is a MCU

### What pins are on a mcu

#### Acranims
- VSS = Voltage Source Source
- VDD = Voltage Drain Drain
#### What they do

- VBAT =
- VCC/VDD = Positive voltage input
- VSS/VEE = Negative voltage, Ground


### things to look at on the data sheet

- input voltage range

- memory
  - program memory amount
  - ram amount

- what data communication are on the MCU
  - SPI
  - UART
  - Serial
  - I2C

- IO pins
  - number of IO pins with interrupt
  - number of fast IO pins
  - number of 5V IO pins
