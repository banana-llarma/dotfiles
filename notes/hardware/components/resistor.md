### What dose a resistor do

A Resistor is defined as a passive electrical component with two terminals that
are used for either limiting or regulating the flow of electric current in
electrical circuits. The main purpose of resistor is to reduce the current
flow and to lower the voltage in any particular portion of the circuit.

A resistor is used to restrict the current to the circuit

### What is a variable resistor

A variable resistor is a type of resistor whose electrical resistance value can
be adjusted on demand. Definition of Variable Resistor It is an electronic
component. It is applied in an electronic circuit for adjusting circuit
resistance to control voltage or current of that circuit or part of that
circuit.

A variable resistor is a resistor that can change it's resistance value
