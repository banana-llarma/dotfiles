### What is a capacitor

A capacitor is an electrical component used to store energy in an electric
field. It has two electrical conductors separated by a dielectric material that
both accumulate charge when connected to a power source. One plate gets a
negative charge, and the other gets a positive charge. A capacitor does
not dissipate energy, unlike a resistor.

A capacitor is used to clean up any noise or AC for sensitive component
