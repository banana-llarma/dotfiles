Usestate is used to change the state of a jsx element from a users input. Usestate makes a array with two variables varible one will be called V1 and varible two will be called V2. V1 is a normal string or number or object and V2 is a function that is used to change the value of the V1. You can change the value of V1 with a function **Example** `const doubler = () => V2(prevVal => prevVal * 2)` this will change V1 to double every time you use the function doubler.
