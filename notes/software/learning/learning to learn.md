### There is a difference to learning facts and learning concepts

Learning a fact is just memorising a peace of a information.  
But a concepts is knowing how it works instead of just memorising information.  
So if you learn a concepts then learn the facts it will be easier to learn because you already know the concepts to the information so you can link the concepts to the fact.
